CIDR Subnet Calculator

Description: This repository contains a web-based CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) subnet calculator. It allows you to calculate and visualize all available IP addresses within a specified CIDR range. The calculator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be easily embedded on your website or used as a standalone tool. You can enter an IP address and a CIDR notation to calculate and display the range of IP addresses within that subnet.

Features:

-   Input fields for IP address and CIDR notation.
-   Simple and user-friendly interface.
-   Accurate calculations of subnet addresses.
-   Easily customizable for your specific needs.

Usage:

1.  Enter an IP address in the "Enter IP Address" field.
2.  Enter the CIDR notation (e.g., /24) in the "Enter CIDR Notation" field.
3.  Click the "Calculate" button to see all available IP addresses within the specified CIDR range.
